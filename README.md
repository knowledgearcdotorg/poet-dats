# Po.et Digital Asset Timestamp

The Po.et DATS adds an asset's metadata to the Po.et ledger and uses the returned work hash to copyright the asset.

Currently, the Po.et DATS is only compatible with EXIF-based images (TIFF and JPEG) but could be expanded to support a number of different asset types. It could also be extended to invisibly watermark images with a Po.et hash.
